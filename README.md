Some People Wrote Some Titles And Their Uninspired Use Of Adverbs Are Literally Uninteresting

## Absorb
TODO: Pay attention to your Teachers `(RSS, Twitter, page scrapings)`, interpret Words of your Teachers, write `(SQL, NoSQL, flat file)` everything down to Learn.

## Learn
TODO: Understand `(TensorFlow, PyBrain)` stored information. Make your own Words. This is the hard bit.

## Regurgitate
```Bash
python main.py
```

TODO: Use your Learning to spread the Words of the Teachers. You are motivated, you too can be like Them. Spew `(p5.js, React)` what you have Learned (in your own Words, of course) upon the Unenlightened.
